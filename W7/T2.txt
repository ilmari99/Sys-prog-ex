T2

The vector-global-order.c avoids a deadlock by always first
locking the smaller vector.

There is a special case when source and dest are equal, because
if they are the same, you can only acquire the lock once.

-n; -l;     time (s)
2;  100000; 0.03
2;  1000000;0.14
20; 10000;  0.47
32; 1000000:7.74

When the -p flag is enabled, the execution time is still heavily
correlated with the number of loops (-l). But only slightly
correlated with the -n, because the threads are not waiting so much.
