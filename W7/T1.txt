Running "./vector-deadlock" with different arguments might cause the threads to deadlock, but from my testing it happens very rarely.
I used the -d and -v flags, and multiple -n and -l combinations. The chance of deadlocking increases as either -l or -n is increased,
since then the calls to get the lock are increased.

If n=1, then there is no possibility for a deadlock.
